Adequacy refers to how well the translation conveys the meaning of the original text. The original text \"colui del quale tu tti solevi dolere ch' era amante della tua donna\" means \"the one about whom you used to complain because he was your woman's lover.\" The translation \"Quello che un tempo ti faceva soffrire, il suo amante della tua donna\" means \"The one who used to make you suffer, her lover of your woman.\" While the translation captures the general idea, it's somewhat awkward and doesn't fully capture the nuance of the original. The phrase \"il suo amante della tua donna\" is grammatically incorrect and sounds unnatural in modern Italian. A more accurate translation would be something like \"Colui che ti faceva soffrire perché era l'amante della tua donna.\" Therefore, Expert 1's score of 1 is too low, as the translation does convey *some* meaning.

While birds *are* animals, the original text specifically refers to birds. This is a loss of specificity. The phrase \"di tutte le cose sa rendere vero giudicio\" is translated to \"di tutto ciò che può render vero giudizio\". This changes the meaning slightly. The original implies the subject can judge *everything*, while the translation implies the subject can only judge things that *can* be judged. This is a significant shift.

Expert 1's score of 1 is too harsh.\n\n*   **Style:** The original text has an archaic style. The translation uses modern Italian, which is a stylistic shift.
