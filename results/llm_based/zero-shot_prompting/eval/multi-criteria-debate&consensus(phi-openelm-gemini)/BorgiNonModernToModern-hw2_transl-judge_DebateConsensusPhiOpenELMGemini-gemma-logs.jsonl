Expert 1 gives a generally positive assessment, while Expert 2 deems the translation very poor.\n\nLet's break down each criterion:\n\n*   **Adequacy:** This refers to how well the translation conveys the meaning of the original text. The translation accurately reflects the literal meaning of the archaic Italian. The core information about climbing onto the edge of the ditch and fence to defend themselves or escape is preserved. However, the archaic \"ne salìo\" is rendered as \"Non salì\" which changes the meaning to \"did not climb\" instead of \"climbed\". This is a significant error. Therefore, Expert 2's score of 1 is more accurate.\n\n*   **Fluency:** This refers to how natural and readable the translation is in the target language. The modern Italian translation is grammatically correct and uses common vocabulary. However, the repetition of \"in sul bordo\" is slightly clunky and could be improved. Given the error in Adequacy, the fluency is negatively impacted. Expert 2's score of 1 is more accurate.\n\n*   **Style:** This refers to how well the translation matches the style and tone of the original text. The original text is archaic Italian, which has a certain formality and rhythm. The modern Italian translation is relatively neutral and doesn't attempt to replicate the archaic style. Given the error in Adequacy, the style is negatively impacted. Expert 2's score of 1 is more accurate.\n\n*   **Completeness:** This refers to whether the translation includes all the information from the original text. The translation includes all the essential information, but the change in meaning from \"climbed\" to \"did not climb\" is a major omission.
