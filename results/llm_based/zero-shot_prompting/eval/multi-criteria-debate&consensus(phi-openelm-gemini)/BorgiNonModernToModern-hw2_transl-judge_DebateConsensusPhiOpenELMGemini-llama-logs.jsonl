A score of 3 would be more appropriate.\n\n*   **Style:** Expert 1 gives a 1, while Expert 2 gives a 5. Style refers to how well the translation matches the tone and register of the original text. The original text is in archaic Italian, which has a more formal and elaborate style. The translation is in modern Italian, which is more informal and direct. The translation loses some of the formality and elegance of the original. Expert 1's score of 1 is too low. Expert 2's score of 5 is too high. A score of 2 would be more appropriate.\n\n*   **Completeness:** Expert 1 gives a 1, while Expert 2 gives a 5. Completeness refers to how much of the original text is included in the translation.

Style refers to how well the translation matches the style of the original text. The original text is archaic and somewhat formal. The translation is in modern Italian, which inherently changes the style. However, it doesn't attempt to replicate the formality or complexity of the original. Expert 1's score is too low. Expert 2's score of 4 is too high. A score of 2 or 3 would be more appropriate, reflecting the shift in style due to modernization.\n\n*   **Completeness:** Expert 1 gives a score of 1, while Expert 2 gives a score of 5. Completeness refers to how much of the original text is included in the translation. The translation omits \"la colpa del servo\" (the servant's fault). This is a significant omission. Expert 1's score is more accurate. Expert 2's score is far too high.

This results in a translation that is technically adequate but stylistically awkward for a modern audience.

Both experts agree on the low scores, indicating substantial issues.\n\n*   **Adequacy:** The translation conveys the basic idea of a separation and intolerance of the other person's presence. However, it omits the archaic \"sia in mezzo\" (be between us) which implies a mediator or a clear division, and the strong emphasis on the speaker's unwillingness to allow the other to stay (\"non lo sofferrò e non lo lascerò\"). The translation is a very simplified version. Therefore, Adequacy should remain at 1.\n\n*   **Fluency:** The modern Italian is grammatically correct and natural. Therefore, Fluency should be increased to 4.\n\n*   **Style:** The original has a formal, almost theatrical, tone due to the archaic language. The translation is very informal and direct, losing the original's stylistic features. Therefore, Style should remain at 1.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The translation omits key elements of the original, such as the implication of a mediator and the strong emphasis on the speaker's unwillingness to allow the other to stay.
