Adequacy refers to how well the translation conveys the meaning of the original text. The translation is almost identical to the original, with only a slight modernization of \"quella guerra ben fatta l' opera perché\" to \"La guerra ben fatto l'opera perché\". While the modernization is minimal, it does preserve the core meaning. However, the \"...\" indicates a missing portion of the original text, which significantly impacts adequacy. Therefore, Expert 2's score of 5 is too high. Expert 1's score of 1 is also too low, as the provided translation *does* convey *some* meaning. A score of 3 seems more appropriate, acknowledging the partial preservation of meaning despite the missing part.\n\n*   **Fluency:** Expert 1 gives a score of 1, while Expert 2 gives a score of 4. Fluency refers to how natural and readable the translation is in the target language. The translation reads somewhat awkwardly in modern Italian, partly due to the archaic sentence structure retained from the original. The phrase \"La guerra ben fatto l'opera perché...\" is not entirely natural. Expert 1's score of 1 is too harsh, as the rest of the sentence is understandable. Expert 2's score of 4 is too generous.

The translation captures the core meaning of the original. The main difference is the verb tense change (\"fuggitte\" to \"fuggono\"). While \"fuggono\" is a valid modern translation, it loses some of the archaic flavor and potentially a nuance of immediacy or past action implied by \"fuggitte.\" Therefore, a score of 3 seems more appropriate as the core meaning is preserved, but some nuance is lost.\n\n*   **Fluency:** Expert 1 gives a 1, while Expert 2 gives a 5.
