Adequacy refers to how well the translation conveys the meaning of the original text. The translation is mostly accurate in conveying the core meaning. \"Iscaciati\" is maintained, \"dipartiti\" becomes \"dipartiamo\" (a slight tense shift, but acceptable), \"debito dela cittade\" becomes \"debito\" (simplification, but understandable), and the final clause is kept. However, the simplification of \"debito dela cittade\" to just \"debito\" loses some of the original's specificity. The tense shift from \"dipartiti\" to \"dipartiamo\" is also a minor issue. Therefore, a score of 3 or 4 seems more appropriate than 1 or 5.\n\n*   **Fluency:** Expert 1 gives a score of 1, while Expert 2 gives a score of 4.

A score of 3 or 4 seems reasonable.\n\n*   **Style:** Expert 1 gives a score of 1, while Expert 2 gives a score of 5. Style refers to how well the translation matches the style of the original text. The original text has an archaic style. The translation is in modern Italian, so it inevitably loses some of the original's stylistic features. However, it doesn't introduce any jarringly modern elements. A score of 2 or 3 seems appropriate, reflecting the loss of the archaic style but avoiding overly modern phrasing.\n\n*   **Completeness:** Both experts give a score of 1.
