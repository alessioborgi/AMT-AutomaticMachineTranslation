Adequacy refers to how well the translation conveys the meaning of the original text. The translation has some significant issues. \"Che prendessero la paga dal camarlingo per loro dispensa\" means \"that they received payment from the chamberlain for their dispensation/exemption\". The translation \"che pagavano il camarlingo per la loro dispensazione\" means \"that they paid the chamberlain for their dispensation\". This is a complete reversal of meaning. Also, \"alla presenzia di messer lo papa\" means \"to the presence of Mr. the Pope\" or \"to the presence of the Pope\". The translation \"alla presenza del papato\" means \"to the presence of the papacy\". While related, it's not the same thing. Finally, \"contradiare il passamento\" means \"to oppose the passage\". The translation \"contraddire il passaggio\" is correct.
